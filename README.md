# TrackWalker
This is a repository for all code related to the track walking project.

The following document is meant to be a guide to starting work on this project, please see EvÃ« Maquelin (maquelea@rose-hulman.edu) for more information.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to generate a RoseLap track file (see TrackGen project for details) from encoder data.

As of 2017-28-11, the plan is to use a wheeled device with two encoders a set distance apart (say, D) and use their differences in angular displacement to determine the curvature of the track at various points. [This file](reference/CurvatureThing.m) has an example of how that will work. From that data we can generate a list of RoseLap compatible track segments which can then be used for analysis.

## Tasks

## Arduino Setup
As of 2017-28-11, there is an Arduino set up to read the data from a single encoder. It is wired as shown below.

Though perhaps hard to make out, the general idea is that black is ground (GND), and the green and white encoder wires are connected to digital pins 3 and 4. The arduino can be connected to any computer with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and data can be read through the Serial Monitor (Tools -> Serial Monitor) after uploading [code such as this](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/RotaryEncoders) to the arduino.
